The objective of this project is to predict the chances of a person being affected by cardiovascular disease using features like age, gender, height, weight, diabetic blood pressure, cholesterol levels, glucose levels etc. Data-driven analyses improve the prediction models, enabling care providers and public health authorities to design and optimize diagnosis and care for groups that are more likely to be affected by these diseases.

Different models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest and AdaBoost. Of these, logistic regression are used to predict heart disease with the best accuracy being 84%.
